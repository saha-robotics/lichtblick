# Preload Agent

You are an expert on the Lichtblick caching and preloading subsystem — the layer that manages memory-efficient buffering of time-series data. There are two preloading mechanisms: the **BlockLoader** (player-level, block-based) and **unstable_subscribeMessageRange** (panel-level, streaming).

## Architecture

```
DataSource (raw bytes)
    │
    ▼
CachingIterableSource (LRU block cache, 600MB budget)
    │
    ▼
BufferedIterableSource (producer-consumer, read-ahead buffer)
    │
    ├── BlockLoader (fixed-duration blocks → PlayerState.progress)
    │       └── panels receive via allFrames/progress in renderState
    │
    └── getBatchIterator (per-topic async iterator)
            └── unstable_subscribeMessageRange (panel-level streaming)
                    └── createMessageRangeIterator (conversion + batching)
                            └── panels consume via onNewRangeIterator callback
    │
    ▼
Player (serves to MessagePipeline)
```

## Two Preloading Mechanisms

### 1. BlockLoader (Player-Level)
- Panels subscribe with `preload: true` → Player's BlockLoader loads data
- Data exposed via `PlayerState.progress.messageCache` (block array)
- Fixed-duration blocks, memory-bounded by `cacheSizeBytes`
- Used by: no panels currently — being superseded by `unstable_subscribeMessageRange`

### 2. unstable_subscribeMessageRange (Panel-Level)
- Panels call `context.unstable_subscribeMessageRange({ topic, convertTo, onNewRangeIterator })`
- Returns an unsubscribe function for cleanup
- Data streamed via `AsyncIterable<MessageEvent[]>` batches
- Panel controls its own buffering/accumulation
- Used by: ThreeDeeRender (transform preloading), Map panel (all frame messages), Plot panel (full time range), StateTransitions panel

## Core Components

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `BlockLoader.ts` | Divides time range into fixed-duration blocks, preloads based on subscribed topics |
| `CachingIterableSource.ts` | LRU cache with 600MB budget, 50MB max block size, eviction behind read head |
| `BufferedIterableSource.ts` | Producer-consumer with VecQueue, read-ahead 10s default (120s for MCAP) |
| `useSubscribeMessageRange.ts` | Hook exposing `unstable_subscribeMessageRange` to panels |
| `messageRangeIterator.ts` | Creates async iterable with conversion + time-based batching |

## CachingIterableSource

### Memory Budget
- Default: **600MB** total cache budget (`cacheSizeBytes`)
- Max block: **50MB** per individual cache block
- Eviction: LRU, evicts blocks **behind** the current read position first

### Block Management
- Data is divided into time-based blocks
- Each block holds decoded messages for a time range
- Blocks are keyed by `(startTime, endTime, topics)`
- Cache hit: return block directly. Cache miss: read from source, store, return.

### Eviction Strategy
```
[evicted] [evicted] [current read position] [cached] [cached] [not loaded]
                              ▲
                    Eviction happens behind here
```

## BufferedIterableSource

### Producer-Consumer Pattern
- **Producer**: reads ahead from the underlying source into `VecQueue`
- **Consumer**: IterablePlayer's tick loop pulls messages from the buffer
- Read-ahead: 10 seconds default, **120 seconds for MCAP** (sequential chunk reading benefits from longer prefetch)
- Backpressure: producer pauses when buffer is full

### VecQueue
- Ring-buffer-style queue optimized for sequential message storage
- Avoids repeated allocations during steady-state playback
- Supports efficient drain (consumer takes all buffered messages at once)

## BlockLoader

### Purpose
Preloads blocks of data for panels that need historical context (e.g., Plot panel showing full time range).

### Behavior
- Divides the data source's time range into fixed-duration blocks
- Loads blocks based on which topics panels have subscribed to for preloading
- Reports progress to the Player, which exposes it via `PlayerState.progress`
- Memory-bounded by `cacheSizeBytes` — older blocks are evicted when budget exceeded

### Topic-Based Loading
- Only preloads topics that panels have explicitly requested via `preloadType: "full"`
- Other topics are loaded on-demand during playback (not preloaded)

## Performance Critical Paths

1. **120s MCAP read-ahead**: Sequential chunk reads are fast; large buffer avoids seek latency
2. **Eviction behind read head**: Keeps forward data cached, frees memory from data already played
3. **50MB block cap**: Prevents single large topic from consuming entire cache budget
4. **Topic filtering**: Only preloads subscribed topics — avoids loading unused data
5. **Batch interval (16ms)**: `createMessageRangeIterator` yields batches at frame rate to avoid blocking
6. **Progressive UI updates (50ms)**: ThreeDeeRender debounces state updates during loading
7. **Cancellation on unmount**: Prevents memory leaks from orphaned iterators

## unstable_subscribeMessageRange

### API

```typescript
type SubscribeMessageRangeArgs = {
  topic: string;
  convertTo?: string;
  onNewRangeIterator: (batchIterator: AsyncIterable<Immutable<MessageEvent[]>>) => Promise<void>;
};

// Usage:
const unsubscribe = context.unstable_subscribeMessageRange({
  topic: "/tf",
  onNewRangeIterator: async (batchIterator) => {
    for await (const batch of batchIterator) {
      // process batch of messages
    }
  },
});
// cleanup:
unsubscribe();
```

### Implementation Flow
1. Panel calls `unstable_subscribeMessageRange({ topic, convertTo, onNewRangeIterator })`
2. `useSubscribeMessageRange` hook gets `getBatchIterator(topic)` from MessagePipeline
3. `createMessageRangeIterator` wraps the raw iterator with:
   - Message conversion (via `collateTopicSchemaConversions` + `convertMessage`)
   - Time-based batching (`BATCH_INTERVAL_MS` = 16ms between yields)
   - Cancellation token (set by returned unsubscribe function)
4. `onNewRangeIterator` receives the `AsyncIterable<MessageEvent[]>` and consumes it
5. Panel accumulates messages in its own buffer (e.g., `messageBuffer` in ThreeDeeRender)

### Cancellation
- `createMessageRangeIterator` returns `{ iterable, cancel }`
- `cancel()` sets `cancelled = true` → iterator stops yielding
- Panel cleanup (useLayoutEffect return) calls the unsubscribe function

### ThreeDeeRender Usage Pattern
```typescript
// Transform preloading in ThreeDeeRender.tsx
const unsubscribe = context.unstable_subscribeMessageRange({
  topic: topic.topic,
  convertTo: topic.convertTo,
  onNewRangeIterator: async (batchIterator) => {
    for await (const batch of batchIterator) {
      messageBuffer.push(...batch);
      // Progressive UI update every 50ms
      if (now - lastUpdateTime > UPDATE_DEBOUNCE_MS) {
        updateAllFrames();
      }
    }
  },
});
```

Key patterns:
- Accumulates in `messageBuffer: MessageEvent[]`
- Sorts by `receiveTime` and trims to `maxMessages` before setting state
- Progressive loading: updates UI every 50ms during loading
- `reloadPreloadTrigger` state allows re-subscribing (clear + reload)
- `isLoadingTransforms` / `loadedTransformCount` for loading indicator

### Map Panel Usage Pattern
```typescript
// MapPanel.tsx subscribes per eligible topic
const unsubscribe = context.unstable_subscribeMessageRange({
  topic: topic.name,
  onNewRangeIterator: async (batchIterator) => {
    for await (const batch of batchIterator) {
      const messages = batch.map(toMapMessage);
      setAllMapMessages((prev) => [...prev, ...messages]);
    }
  },
});
```
